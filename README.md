# PACSxVIRO Food Management App

## Overview

Welcome to the PACSxVIRO Food Management App â€“ an initiative by the Practical Application of Computer Science (PACS) club in collaboration with VIRO. This Android application aims to reduce food waste by connecting event organizers with students and club members interested in receiving surplus food after events. The app facilitates a sustainable solution, ensuring that excess food doesn't go to waste and benefits those in need.

### Features

  Event organizers can post details about leftover food, including club name, pickup location, stock availability, and additional information.

- **User Accessibility:**
  Students and club members can view available surplus food, making it easy for them to find and pick up free meals.

- **Firebase Authentication:**
  Securely log in using Firebase Authentication, ensuring a reliable and authenticated user experience.

- **Firebase Cloud Database:**
